    Find a the supercell scaling matrix that gives the most cubic supercell for a
    structure, where the supercell has between the minimum and maximum nubmer of atoms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    structure : pymatgen.Structure
        Unitcell of a structure
    min_atoms : target number of atoms in the supercell, defaults to 5
    max_atoms : int
        Maximum number of atoms allowed in the supercell
    target_shape : str
        Target shape of supercell. Could choose 'sc' for simple cubic or 'fcc' for face centered
        cubic. Default is 'sc'.
    lower_search_limit : int
        How far to search below the 'ideal' cubic scaling. Default is -2.
    upper_search_limit : int
        How far to search below the 'ideal' cubic scaling. Default is 2.
    verbose : bool
        Whether to print extra details on the cell shapes and scores. Useful for debugging.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        2d array of a scaling matrix, e.g. [[3,0,0],[0,3,0],[0,0,3]]

    Notes
    -----
    The motiviation for this is for use in phonon calculations and defect calculations.
    It is important that defect atoms are far enough apart that they do not interact.
    Scaling unit cells that are not cubic by even dimensions might result in interacting
    defects. An example would be a tetragonal cell with 2x8x8 Ang lattice vectors being
    made into a 2x2x2 supercell. Atoms along the first dimension would not be very far
    apart.

    We are using a pure Python implementation from ASE, which is not very fast for a given
    supercell size. This allows for a variable supercell size, so it's going to be slow
    for a large range of atoms.

    The search limits are passed directloy to ``find_optimal_cell_shape_pure_python``.
    They define the search space for each individual supercell based on the "ideal" scaling.
    For example, a cell with 4 atoms and a target size of 110 atoms might have an ideal scaling
    of 3x3x3. The search space for a lower and upper limit of -2/+2 would be 1-5. Since the
    calculations are based on the cartesian product of 3x3 matrices, large search ranges are
    very expensive.
