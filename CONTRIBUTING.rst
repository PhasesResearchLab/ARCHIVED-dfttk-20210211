Project Goals
-------------

1. Privately store code for projects in progress
2. Provide access to workflows for PRL group use that are not suitable for atomate due to privacy, code quality, or project scope

How to Contribute 
-----------------

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create a new branch for your addition or changes (``git checkout -b mybranchname``)
3. Write code or make changes and commit them to your branch
4. (Recommended) If you have multiple commits, clean up your commit history (``git rebase -i myfirstcommithash^ HEAD``)
5. Push your branch to the repository (``git push origin mybranchname``)
6. Submit a merge request

After you submit a merge request, other members of the group are able to review your changes and give feedback. Someone with a rank of Master or higher in the project can merge your commits into the master branch.
