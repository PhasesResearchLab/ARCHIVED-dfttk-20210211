You can also find some scripts for basic atomate calculations in the `scripts` folder. Simply configure the settings as you want them run the script using Python on a system that is configured to connect to your LaunchPad. The scripts are designed to be flexible enough to run to scaffold basic calculations you might run. The `examples` folder contains real examples of workflows that have been used.
