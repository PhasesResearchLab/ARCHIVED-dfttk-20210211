This folder contains the compounds/phases used to test the DFTTK package.
To be done works inculde the Bore effective charge calculations for the phonon properties
under each folder:
dir "Yphon" - all data input/output for Yphon, e.x., hessian matrix (superfij.out), calculated phonon dos
dir "figures" - plots in png format for most of the thermodynamic properities
file "readme" - This file
file "record.json" - SGTE fitting record for heat capacity, Gibbs energy, enthalpy, and entropy at given temperature range
file "key_vasp_parameters.json" - The calculated band gap, pseudopotential, and kpoints
